I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science (2024 - present) at the [School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn) (CUHK-Shenzhen), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from CUHK-Shenzhen in 2024.
Currently, I am a research intern at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/en/about), working under the guidance of Dr. Yan Wang and Dr. Zhaopeng Tu. I also collaborate closely with Prof. Wenxuan Wang from Renmin University of China.

My current research focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM Reasoning) and developing insightful evaluation protocols to benchmark their performance (Model Evaluation).
